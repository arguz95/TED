## Objective:

TED talks are video recordings of influential talks given at and hosted by TED Conferences LLC. TED was founded in 1984, and has since built a reputation for spreading inspiring powerful ideas in fields ranging from tech to science to education, with its videos having garnered over 1 billion views to date.

The goal of this project is to use various features associated with TED talks -- such as the topic, speaker, conference year, and length of the talk -- to predict the number of views a TED talk may receive.

# Data preprocessing
## Setup
First, let's import a few common modules, ensure MatplotLib plots figures inline and prepare a function to save the figures. We also check that Python 3.5 or later is installed as well as Scikit-Learn (V ≥0.20).

# Python ≥3.5 is required
import sys
assert sys.version_info >= (3, 5)

# Scikit-Learn ≥0.20 is required
import sklearn
assert sklearn.__version__ >= "0.20"

# Common imports
import numpy as np
import os

# To plot pretty figures
%matplotlib inline
import matplotlib as mpl
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
mpl.rc('axes', labelsize=14)
mpl.rc('xtick', labelsize=12)
mpl.rc('ytick', labelsize=12)

# Where to save the figures
PROJECT_ROOT_DIR = "."
CHAPTER_ID = "end_to_end_project"
IMAGES_PATH = os.path.join(PROJECT_ROOT_DIR, "images", CHAPTER_ID)
os.makedirs(IMAGES_PATH, exist_ok=True)

def save_fig(fig_id, tight_layout=True, fig_extension="png", resolution=300):
    path = os.path.join(IMAGES_PATH, fig_id + "." + fig_extension)
    print("Saving figure", fig_id)
    if tight_layout:
        plt.tight_layout()
    plt.savefig(path, format=fig_extension, dpi=resolution)

# Ignore useless warnings (see SciPy issue #5998)
import warnings
warnings.filterwarnings(action="ignore", message="^internal gelsd")
